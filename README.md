- Formula to configure New Relic via pillar (see pillar.example)

## TODO

1. Plugin uses MeetMe's multi-plugin python-based agent. Will include the ability to use New Relic Platform
   Installer (NPI) utility which is java-based.
1. Now that there is a method to locate PHP ini dir, could create templated newrelic.ini file instead of 
   relying on official newrelic-install script
