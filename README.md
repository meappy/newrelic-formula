# New Relic Formula
Formula to configure New Relic via pillar (see pillar.example)

----

Fully functioning New Relic Formula, includes setting up system, application agents and application plugins 

Plugin uses MeetMe's multi-plugin python-based agent. Will include the ability to use New Relic Platform Installer
(NPI) utility which is java-based.


TODO

1. Now that there is a method to locate PHP ini dir, could create templated newrelic.ini file instead of 
   relying on official newrelic-install script
